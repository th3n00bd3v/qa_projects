## Test Techniques

| **Technique**                    | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Black Box Testing**             | Focuses on testing the functionality of the application without knowing its internal workings. |
| **White Box Testing**             | Involves testing the internal structure of the application, including code and logic. |
| **Grey Box Testing**              | A combination of both black box and white box testing, where testers have partial knowledge of the internal workings. |
| **Boundary Value Analysis**       | Tests the boundaries of input values (e.g., minimum and maximum values) to find edge cases. |
| **Equivalence Partitioning**      | Divides input data into equivalent classes, ensuring that test cases cover each partition to minimize test cases. |
| **Decision Table Testing**        | Uses a decision table to model complex business logic, verifying all possible conditions and actions. |
| **State Transition Testing**      | Tests how the application behaves when transitioning between different states based on inputs or actions. |
| **Pairwise Testing**              | Focuses on testing combinations of two parameters at a time to reduce the number of test cases while maintaining coverage. |
| **Error Guessing**                | Involves testers using their experience to guess where defects might occur and creating test cases based on that. |
| **Exploratory Testing**           | Involves testers exploring the application freely to identify unexpected behaviors or issues not covered in scripted tests. |
| **Ad-Hoc Testing**                | Informal testing performed without any test planning, execution, or documentation, often to catch critical bugs quickly. |
| **Stress Testing**                | Tests the application under extreme conditions, such as high load or resource consumption, to verify stability and performance. |
| **Performance Testing**           | Evaluates how well the application performs under normal and peak conditions, including response time and scalability. |
