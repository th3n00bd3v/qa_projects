### 3. Test Case Design
- **Test Case 1: Valid Login - standard_user**
  - **Input**: Username: `standard_user`, Password: `secret_sauce`
  - **Expected Output**: Successful login, redirected to the product page.

- **Test Case 2: Valid Login - problem_user**
  - **Input**: Username: `problem_user`, Password: `secret_sauce`
  - **Expected Output**: Successful login, possible issues on the product page (e.g., missing images or text).

- **Test Case 3: Valid Login - performance_glitch_user**
  - **Input**: Username: `performance_glitch_user`, Password: `secret_sauce`
  - **Expected Output**: Successful login with a performance delay (e.g., slow loading of the product page).

- **Test Case 4: Invalid Login - Locked Out User**
  - **Input**: Username: `locked_out_user`, Password: `secret_sauce`
  - **Expected Output**: Error message: "Sorry, this user has been locked out."

- **Test Case 5: Invalid Login - Incorrect Password**
  - **Input**: Username: `standard_user`, Password: `wrong_password`
  - **Expected Output**: Error message: "Username and password do not match any user in this service."

- **Test Case 6: Invalid Login - Incorrect Username**
  - **Input**: Username: `non_existent_user`, Password: `secret_sauce`
  - **Expected Output**: Error message: "Username and password do not match any user in this service."

- **Test Case 7: Empty Username and Password**
  - **Input**: Username: (empty), Password: (empty)
  - **Expected Output**: Error message: "Username is required" and "Password is required."

- **Test Case 8: Empty Username**
  - **Input**: Username: (empty), Password: `secret_sauce`
  - **Expected Output**: Error message: "Username is required."

- **Test Case 9: Empty Password**
  - **Input**: Username: `standard_user`, Password: (empty)
  - **Expected Output**: Error message: "Password is required."

- **Test Case 10: Password Visibility Toggle**
  - **Input**: Username: `standard_user`, Password: `secret_sauce`
  - **Action**: Toggle password visibility and check if the password is correctly displayed.
  - **Expected Output**: Password should toggle visibility on and off.

- **Test Case 11: Login Button Disabled on Empty Fields**
  - **Input**: Username: (empty), Password: (empty)
  - **Action**: Verify if the login button is disabled when fields are empty.
  - **Expected Output**: The login button should be disabled.

- **Test Case 12: Field Focus**
  - **Input**: Username: `standard_user`, Password: `secret_sauce`
  - **Action**: Click on each field (Username, Password, Login) and verify proper focus behavior.
  - **Expected Output**: The correct field should be highlighted when clicked.

### 4. Test Environment Setup
- **Web Environment**:
  - Browser: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
  - Device: Desktop (preferred) or mobile (optional)
  - Network: Ensure a stable internet connection for normal and performance glitch scenarios.

### 5. Test Execution
- **Execution**:
  - Execute all test cases in the defined sequence.
  - Log results for each test case: Pass/Fail.
  - For failed tests, report the issue in the defect management system.

### 6. Defect Reporting
- **Report**:
  - Document defects found during testing (e.g., failed test cases like "locked_out_user" login).
  - Include details such as:
    - Steps to reproduce
    - Expected vs actual results
    - Severity and priority
    - Screenshots or screen recordings
- **Tracking**:
  - Assign the defect to the development team for fixing.

### 7. Test Result Evaluation
- **Compare Results**:
  - Compare the actual results to the expected outputs from the test cases.
  - Ensure that each functionality (successful login, error messages, performance issues, etc.) behaves as expected.

### 8. Regression Testing
- **Re-run**:
  - If defects are fixed or new changes are introduced, perform regression testing to ensure no other areas are affected.

### 9. Test Closure
- **Final Reporting**:
  - Document all test results, including test case execution status, defects reported, and severity.
  - Summarize testing efforts, including any issues found and their resolution status.

- **Sign-Off**:
  - If all criteria are met (i.e., all critical issues resolved and the login functionality works as expected), give the sign-off for release.
