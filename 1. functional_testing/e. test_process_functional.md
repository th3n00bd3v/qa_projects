## Test Process

| **Step**                         | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Requirement Analysis**         | Review functional specifications, user stories, or use cases to understand expected behavior. |
| **Test Plan Creation**           | Develop a test plan that outlines objectives, scope, resources, schedule, and entry/exit criteria. |
| **Test Case Design**             | Create detailed test cases based on functional requirements, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases. |
| **Test Environment Setup**       | Prepare the required hardware, software, network, and tools for testing. |
| **Test Execution**               | Execute the test cases against the application and record the results. |
| **Defect Reporting**             | Identify and document any defects found during testing, providing detailed steps for replication. |
| **Test Result Evaluation**       | Compare actual results with expected results to determine if the functionality works as intended. |
| **Regression Testing**           | Re-run previously passed test cases to ensure that new changes didnâ€™t break existing functionality. |
| **Test Closure**                 | Finalize test execution, report on results, and prepare for the delivery or release of the software. |
