| **Integration Testing**            | Verifies that different modules or components work together as expected. |
| **System Testing**                 | Tests the complete system to ensure it meets all requirements and functions correctly. |
| **Smoke Testing**                  | A quick check to ensure the basic functionality of the application is working. |
| **Sanity Testing**                 | Verifies specific functionality or bug fixes without extensive testing. |
| **Regression Testing**             | Ensures new changes donâ€™t negatively affect existing features. |
| **Acceptance Testing**             | Confirms the software meets business requirements and is ready for release. |
| **Alpha Testing**                  | Internal testing by the development team before public release. |
| **Beta Testing**                   | Performed by a limited set of users to find remaining issues before public release. |
| **Interface Testing**              | Tests interactions between systems or modules (e.g., APIs) to ensure proper communication. |
| **Usability Testing**              | Focuses on the user-friendliness and overall experience of the application. |
