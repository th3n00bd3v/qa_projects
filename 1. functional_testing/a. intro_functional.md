# Introduction

## Definition

- Functional testing is a type of software testing that verifies a system’s features and workflows work according to business requirements by checking inputs, outputs, and behavior. In simple terms, it answers the question: “Does the software do what it’s supposed to do?”

- Its scope includes validating individual functions, integrated modules, and complete user journeys. It helps detect bugs early, supports smooth releases, and builds confidence in product quality.

## Purpose

**Tests the Business Logic:** Checks if the underlying business logic of the software is implemented correctly. It involves testing how the software handles different scenarios, inputs, and business rules.

**Validate every functionality:** Involves examining each function and feature of an application. It is done by providing the relevant input and confirming that the output aligns with the requirements.

**Test the UI flow:** Evaluates the flow of the UI to confirm that users can smoothly navigate through the application.
