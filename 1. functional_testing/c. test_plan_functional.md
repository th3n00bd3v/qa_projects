| **Test Plan Objective**             | Defines the purpose of testing, such as verifying that the system meets requirements. |
| **Scope of Testing**                | Specifies what will and wonâ€™t be tested (e.g., specific features, modules, or functionality). |
| **Test Strategy**                   | Outlines the overall approach to testing, including techniques, tools, and resources to be used. |
| **Test Criteria**                   | Defines entry and exit criteria, such as when testing starts and stops, and what conditions must be met. |
| **Test Deliverables**               | Lists the documents, reports, and logs that will be generated during testing (e.g., test cases, test results). |
| **Resource Planning**               | Identifies the required resources, including testers, tools, and environments. |
| **Test Schedule**                   | Provides a timeline of when testing will take place, including milestones and deadlines. |
| **Risk Analysis**                   | Assesses potential risks (e.g., resource constraints, system complexity) and their impact on testing. |
| **Test Environment Setup**          | Specifies the hardware, software, and network configurations needed to conduct the tests. |
| **Test Case Design**                | Describes how test cases will be created, ensuring all functional requirements are covered. |
| **Defect Management**               | Outlines the process for identifying, tracking, and resolving defects during testing. |
| **Communication Plan**              | Defines how the testing team will communicate with stakeholders, including status updates and issue reporting. |
